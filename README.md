# Stanford CS1 Compilers Course

This is a collection of the material I am using for the Stanford compilers MOOC.

I will update this file as things change, but I believe it will mainly contain solutions to the assignments.

I use the acronym from class, where PA1 means "programming assignment 1."

| Assignment | Topic  |
| ---------- | -----  |
| PA1        | Lexer  |
| PA2        | Parser |
