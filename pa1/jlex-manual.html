<br> <p>
</p><h1><a name="SECTION1">1. Introduction</a></h1>
<p>
A lexical analyzer breaks an input stream of characters 
into tokens.  
Writing lexical analyzers by hand can be a tedious
process, so software tools have been developed to ease
this task.
</p><p>
Perhaps the best known such utility is Lex.  
Lex is a lexical analyzer generator for the UNIX 
operating system, targeted to the C programming language.
Lex takes a specially-formatted specification file
containing the details of a lexical analyzer. 
This tool then creates a C source file for the 
associated table-driven lexer.
</p><p>
The JLex utility is based upon the Lex lexical
analyzer generator model.  JLex takes a specification 
file similar to that accepted by Lex, then 
creates a Java source file for the corresponding lexical
analyzer.
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h1><a name="SECTION2">2. JLex Specifications</a></h1>
<p>
A JLex input file is organized into three sections, 
separated by double-percent directives (``%%'').  
A proper JLex specification has the following format.<br>
<i>user code</i><br>
%%<br>
<i>JLex directives</i><br>
%%<br>
<i>regular expression rules</i><br>
The ``%%'' directives distinguish sections of the input
file and must be placed at the beginning of their line.
The remainder of the line containing the ``%%'' directives
may be discarded and should not be used to house
additional declarations or code.
</p><p>
The user code section - the first section of the specification
file - is copied directly into the resulting output file. 
This area of the specification provides space for the
implementation of utility classes or return types.
</p><p>
The JLex directives section is the second part of the input
file.  Here, macros definitions are given and state names
are declared.
</p><p>
The third section contains the rules of lexical analysis,
each of which consists of three parts: an optional state list,
a regular expression, and an action.
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h2><a name="SECTION2.1">2.1 User Code</a></h2>
<p>
User code precedes the first double-percent directive (``%%').  
This code is copied verbatim into the lexical analyzer source
file that JLex outputs, at the top of the file.
Therefore, if the lexer source file needs to begin 
with a package declaration or with 
the importation of an external class,
the user code section should begin with 
the corresponding declaration.
This declaration will then be copied onto 
the top of the generated source file.
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h2><a name="SECTION2.2">2.2 JLex Directives</a></h2>
<p>
The JLex directive section begins after the first ``%%''
and continues until the second ``%%'' delimiter. 
Each JLex directive should be contained on a single line
and should begin that line.
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h3><a name="SECTION2.2.1">2.2.1 Internal Code to Lexical Analyzer Class</a></h3>
<p>
The <i>%{...%}</i> directive allows the user to write
Java code to be copied into the lexical analyzer class.
This directive is used as follows.<br>
<i>%{ </i><br>
<i>&lt;code&gt; </i><br>
<i>%} </i><br>
To be properly recognized, the <i>%{ </i> and <i>%} </i> 
should each be situated at the beginning of a line.
The specified Java code in <i>&lt;code&gt;</i> will be then copied into
the lexical analyzer class created by JLex.<br>
<i>class Yylex { </i><br>
<i>... &lt;code&gt; ... </i><br>
<i>} </i><br>
This permits the declaration of variables and functions
internal to the generated lexical analyzer class.
Variable names beginning with <i>yy</i> should be
avoided, as these are reserved for use by the generated
lexical analyzer class.
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h3><a name="SECTION2.2.2">2.2.2 Initialization Code for Lexical Analyzer Class</a></h3>
<p>
The <i>%init{ ... %init}</i> directive allows the user to write
Java code to be copied into the constructor for the
lexical analyzer class.<br>
<i>%init{ </i><br>
<i>&lt;code&gt;</i><br>
<i>%init} </i><br>
The <i>%init{</i> and <i>%init}</i> directives
should be situated at the beginning of a line.
The specified Java code in <i>&lt;code&gt;</i> will be then copied into
the lexical analyzer class constructor.<br>
<i>class Yylex { </i><br>
<i>Yylex () { </i><br>
<i>... &lt;code&gt; ... </i><br>
<i>} </i><br>
<i>} </i><br>
This directive permits one-time initializations 
of the lexical analyzer class from inside its constructor.
Variable names beginning with <i>yy</i> should be
avoided, as these are reserved for use by the generated
lexical analyzer class.
</p><p>
The code given in the <i>%init{ ... %init}</i> directive
may potentially throw an exception, or propagate it from
another function.  To declare this exception, use
the <i>%initthrow{ ... %initthrow}</i> directive.<br>
<i>%initthrow{ </i><br>
<i>&lt;exception[1]&gt;</i>[<i>, &lt;exception[2]&gt;, ...</i>]<br>
<i>%initthrow} </i><br>
The Java code specified here will be copied 
into the declaration of the lexical analyzer 
constructor.<br>
<i>Yylex () </i><br>
<i>throws &lt;exception[1]&gt;</i>[<i>, &lt;exception[2]&gt;, ...</i>]<br>
<i>{ </i><br>
<i>... &lt;code&gt; ... </i><br>
<i>} </i><br>
If the Java code given in the <i>%init{ ... %init}</i> 
directive throws an exception that is not declared,
the resulting lexical analyzer source file may not compile
successfully.
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h3><a name="SECTION2.2.3">2.2.3 End-of-File Code for Lexical Analyzer Class</a></h3>
<p>
The <i>%eof{ ... %eof}</i> directive 
allows the user to write Java code to be 
copied into the lexical analyzer class
for execution after the end-of-file is reached.<br>
<i>%eof{ </i><br>
<i>&lt;code&gt;</i><br>
<i>%eof} </i><br>
The <i>%eof{</i> and <i>%eof}</i> directives
should be situated at the beginning of a line.
The specified Java code in <i>&lt;code&gt;</i> 
will be executed at most once, and immediately
after the end-of-file is reached for the input file
the lexical analyzer class is processing.
</p><p>
The code given in the <i>%eof{ ... %eof}</i> directive
may potentially throw an exception, or propagate it from
another function.  To declare this exception, use
the <i>%eofthrow{ ... %eofthrow}</i> directive.<br>
<i>%eofthrow{ </i><br>
<i>&lt;exception[1]&gt;</i>[<i>, &lt;exception[2]&gt;, ...</i>]<br>
<i>%eofthrow} </i><br>
The Java code specified here will be copied 
into the declaration of the lexical analyzer function
called to clean-up upon reaching end-of-file.<br>
<i>private void yy_do_eof () </i><br>
<i>throws &lt;exception[1]&gt;</i>[<i>, &lt;exception[2]&gt;, ...</i>]<br>
<i>{ </i><br>
<i>... &lt;code&gt; ... </i><br>
<i>} </i><br>
The Java code in &lt;code&gt; that makes up 
the body of this function will, in part, 
come from the code given in the
<i>%eof{ ... %eof}</i> directive.
If this code throws an exception that is not declared
using the <i>%eofthrow{ ... %eofthrow}</i> directive,
the resulting lexer may not compile successfully.
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h3><a name="SECTION2.2.4">2.2.4 Macro Definitions</a></h3>
<p>
Macro definitions are given in the JLex directives section 
of the specification.
Each macro definition is contained on a single line and
consists of a macro name followed by an equal sign (=), 
then by its associated definition.
The format can therefore be summarized as follows.<br>
<i>&lt;name&gt;</i> = <i>&lt;definition&gt;</i><br>
Non-newline white space, e.g. blanks and tabs, 
is optional between the macro name and the equal sign
and between the equal sign and the macro definition.
Each macro definition should be contained on a 
single line.
</p><p>
Macro names should be valid identifiers, 
e.g. sequences of letters, digits, and underscores
beginning with a letter or underscore.
</p><p>
Macro definitions should be valid regular expressions,
the details of which are described in another section below.
</p><p>
Macro definitions can contain other macro expansions,
in the standard<br><i>{&lt;name&gt;} </i> format for macros 
within regular expressions.
However, the user should note that these expressions
are macros - not functions or nonterminals - so
mutually recursive constructs using macros are illegal.
Therefore, cycles in macro definitions will have 
unpredictable results.
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h3><a name="SECTION2.2.5">2.2.5 State Declarations</a></h3>
<p>
Lexical states are used to control when certain 
regular expressions are matched.
These are declared in the JLex directives 
in the following way.<br>
<i>%state </i>state[0][<i>, state[1], state[2], ...</i>]<br>
Each declaration of a series of lexical states should
be contained on a single line.
Multiple declarations can be included in the same
JLex specification, so the declaration of many states
can be broken into many declarations over multiple lines.
</p><p>
State names should be valid identifiers,
e.g. sequences of letters, digits, and underscores
beginning with a letter or underscore.
</p><p>
A single lexical state is implicitly declared by JLex.
This state is called <i>YYINITIAL</i>, and the generated
lexer begins lexical analysis in this state.
</p><p>
Rules of lexical analysis begin with an optional state list.
If a state list is given, the lexical rule is matched only when
the lexical analyzer is in one of the specified states.
If a state list is not given, the lexical rule is matched when
the lexical analyzer is in any state.
</p><p>
If a JLex specification does not make use of states,
by neither declaring states nor preceding lexical rules 
with state lists,
the resulting lexer will remain in state <i>YYINITIAL</i>
throughout execution.
Since lexical rules are not prefaced by state lists,
these rules are matched in all existing states,
including the implicitly declared state <i>YYINITIAL</i>.
Therefore, everything works as expected if states are
not used at all.
</p><p>
States are declared as constant integers within the generated 
lexical analyzer class.
The constant integer declared for a declared state 
has the same name as that state.
The user should be careful to avoid name conflict 
between state names and variables declared in the 
action portion of rules or elsewhere within  
the lexical analyzer class.
A convenient convention would be to declare state
names in all capitals, as a reminder that these
identifiers effectively become constants.
</p><p>
<br> </p><p> </p><hr>
<h3><a name="SECTION2.2.6">2.2.6 Character Counting</a></h3>
<p>
Character counting is turned off by default, but can be activated
with the <i>%char</i> directive.<br>
<i>%char</i><br>
The zero-based character index of the first character in
the matched region of text is then placed in the
integer variable <i>yychar</i>.
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h3><a name="SECTION2.2.7">2.2.7 Line Counting</a></h3>
<p>
Line counting is turned off by default, but can be activated
with the <i>%line</i> directive.<br>
<i>%line</i><br>
The zero-based line index at the beginning of the
matched region of text is then placed in the
integer variable <i>yyline</i>.
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h3><a name="SECTION2.2.8">2.2.8 Java CUP Compatibility </a></h3>
<p>
Java CUP is a parser generator for Java originally written
by Scott Hudson of Georgia Tech University, and maintained and
extended by Frank Flannery, Dan Wang, and C. Scott Ananian.
Details of this software tool are on the World Wide Web
at<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/CUP/">http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/CUP/</a>.<br>
Java CUP compatibility is turned off by default, but can 
be activated with the following JLex directive.<br>
<i>%cup</i><br>
When given, this directive makes the generated scanner conform to the
<code>java_cup.runtime.Scanner</code> interface.  It has the same
effect as the following three directives:<br>
<i>%implements java_cup.runtime.Scanner</i><br>
<i>%function next_token</i><br>
<i>%type java_cup.runtime.Symbol</i><br>
See <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/JLex/current/manual.html#SECTION2.2.9">the next section</a> for more details on
these three directives, and the CUP manual for more details on using
CUP and JLex together.
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h3><a name="SECTION2.2.9">2.2.9 Lexical Analyzer Component Titles</a></h3>
<p>
The following directives can be used to change the name of
the generated lexical analyzer class, the tokenizing function, and
the token return type.  To change the name of the lexical
analyzer class from <i>Yylex</i>, use the 
<i>%class</i> directive.<br>
<i>%class &lt;name&gt;</i><br>
To change the name of the tokenizing function from <i>yylex</i>,
use the <i>%function</i> directive.<br>
<i>%function &lt;name&gt;</i><br>
To change the name of the return type from the tokenizing 
function from <i>Yytoken</i>, use the <i>%type</i> 
directive.<br>
<i>%type &lt;name&gt;</i><br>
If the default names are not altering using these directives,
the tokenizing function is envoked with a call to
<i>Yylex.yylex()</i>, which returns the <i>Ytoken</i> type.
</p><p>
To avoid scoping conflicts, names beginning with <i>yy</i>
are normally reserved for lexical analyzer internal functions
and variables.
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h3><a name="SECTION2.2.10">2.2.10 Default Token Type</a></h3>
<p>
To make the 32-bit primitive integer type <i>int</i>, 
the return type for the tokenizing function 
(and therefore the token type),
use the <i>%integer</i> directive.<br>
<i>%integer</i><br>
Under default settings, <i>Yytoken</i> is the return 
type of the tokenizing function<br><i>Yylex.yylex()</i>,
as in the following code fragment.<br>
<i>class Yylex { ... </i><br>
<i>public Yytoken yylex () {</i><br>
<i>... } </i><br>
The <i>%integer</i> directive replaces the previous code
with a revised declaration, in which the token type 
has been changed to <i>int</i>.<br>
<i>class Yylex { ... </i><br>
<i>public int yylex () {</i><br>
<i>... } </i><br>
This declaration allows lexical actions to return 
integer codes, as in the following code fragment
from a hypothetical lexical action.<br>
<i>{ ...</i><br>
<i>return 7; </i><br>
<i>... } </i>
</p><p>
The integer return type forces changes the behavior
at end of file.
Under default settings, objects - subclasses of the 
java.lang.Object class - are returned by <i>Yylex.yylex()</i>.
During execution of the generated lexer <i>Yylex</i>,
a special object value must be reserved for end-of-file. 
Therefore, when the end-of-file is reached 
for the processed input file (and from then onward), 
<i>Yylex.yylex()</i> returns <i>null</i>.
</p><p>
When <i>int</i> is the return type of <i>Yylex.yylex()</i>,
<i>null</i> can no longer be returned.  Instead,
<i>Yylex.yylex()</i> returns the value -1, corresponding
to constant integer<br><i>Yylex.YYEOF</i>.
The <i>%integer</i> directive implies <i>%yyeof</i>; see below.
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h3><a name="SECTION2.2.11">2.2.11 Default Token Type II: Wrapped Integer</a></h3>
<p>
To make java.lang.Integer the return type for the
tokenizing function (and therefore the token type),
use the <i>%intwrap</i> directive.<br>
<i>%intwrap</i><br>
Under default settings, <i>Yytoken</i> is the return 
type of the tokenizing function<br><i>Yylex.yylex()</i>,
as in the following code fragment.<br>
<i>class Yylex { ... </i><br>
<i>public Yytoken yylex () {</i><br>
<i>... } </i><br>
The <i>%intwrap</i> directive replaces the previous code
with a revised declaration, in which the token type 
has been changed to java.lang.Integer.<br>
<i>class Yylex { ... </i><br>
<i>public java.lang.Integer yylex () {</i><br>
<i>... } </i><br>
This declaration allows lexical actions to return 
wrapped integer codes, as in the following code fragment
from a hypothetical lexical action.<br>
<i>{ ...</i><br>
<i>return new java.lang.Integer(0); </i><br>
<i>... } </i>
</p><p>
Notice that the effect of <i>%intwrap</i> directive can be
equivalently accomplished using the <i>%type</i>
directive, as follows.<br>
<i>%type java.lang.Integer</i><br>
This manually changes the name of the return type
from <i>Yylex.yylex()</i> to<br><i>java.lang.Integer</i>.

<br> <p>
</p><h3><a name="SECTION2.2.12">2.2.12 YYEOF on End-of-File</a></h3>
<p>
The <i>%yyeof</i> directive causes the constant
integer <i>Yylex.YYEOF</i> to be declared.  If
the <i>%integer</i> directive is present, <i>Yylex.YYEOF</i>
is returned upon end-of-file.<br>

<i>%yyeof</i><br>

This directive causes <i>Yylex.YYEOF</i> to be declared as
follows:<br>
<i>public final int YYEOF = -1;</i><br>
The <i>%integer</i> directive implies <i>%yyeof</i>.

<br> <p>
</p><h3><a name="SECTION2.2.13">2.2.13 Newlines and Operating System Compatibility</a></h3>
<p>
In UNIX operating systems, the character code sequence 
representing a newline is the single character ``\n''.
Conversely, in DOS-based operating systems, the newline is
the two-character sequence ``\r\n''
consisting of the carriage return followed by the newline.
The <i>%notunix</i> directive results in either the carriage
return or the newline being recognized as a newline.<br>
<i>%notunix</i><br>
This issue of recognizing the proper sequence of characters
as a newline is important in ensuring Java platform independence.
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h3><a name="SECTION2.2.14">2.2.14 Character Sets</a></h3>
<p>
The default settings support an alphabet 
of character codes between 0 and 127 inclusive.
If the generated lexical analyzer receives 
an input character code that falls outside 
of these bounds, the lexer may fail.
</p><p>
The <i>%full</i> directive can be used 
to extend this alphabet to include
all 8-bit values.<br>
<i>%full</i><br>
If the <i>%full</i> directive is given, 
JLex will generate a lexical analyzer
that supports an alphabet of character codes
between 0 and 255 inclusive.
</p><p>
The <i>%unicode</i> can be used 
to extend the alphabet to include the
full 16-bit Unicode alphabet.<br>
<i>%unicode</i><br>
If the <i>%unicode</i> directive is given, 
JLex will generate a lexical analyzer
that supports an alphabet of character codes
between 0 and 2^16-1 inclusive.
</p><p>
The <i>%ignorecase</i> directive can be given to generate
case-insensitive lexers.<br>
<i>%ignorecase</i><br>
If the <i>%ignorecase</i> directive is given, CUP will expand all
character classes in a unicode-friendly way to match both upper,
lower, and title-case letters.
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h3><a name="SECTION2.2.15">2.2.15 Character Format To and From File</a></h3>
<p>
Under the status quo, JLex and the lexical
analyzer it generates read from and write to
Ascii text files, with byte sized characters.
However, to support further extensions on the JLex tool,
all internal processing of characters is done
using the 16-bit Java character type,
although the full range of 16-bit values is not supported.
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h3><a name="SECTION2.2.16">2.2.16 Exceptions Generated by Lexical Actions</a></h3>
<p>
The code given in the action portion of 
the regular expression rules,
in section three of the JLex specification,
may potentially throw an exception, or propagate 
it from another function.  
To declare these exceptions, use
the <i>%yylexthrow{ ... %yylexthrow}</i> directive.<br>
<i>%yylexthrow{ </i><br>
<i>&lt;exception[1]&gt;</i>[<i>, &lt;exception[2]&gt;, ...</i>]<br>
<i>%yylexthrow} </i><br>
The Java code specified here will be copied 
into the declaration of the lexical analyzer 
tokenizing function <i>Yylex.yylex()</i>, as follows.<br>
<i>public Yytoken yylex () </i><br>
<i>throws &lt;exception[1]&gt;</i>[<i>, &lt;exception[2]&gt;, ...</i>]
<br>
<i>{ </i><br>
<i>... </i><br>
<i>} </i><br>
If the code given in the action portion of 
the regular expression rules
throws an exception that is not declared
using the <i>%yylexthrow{ ... %yylexthrow}</i> directive,
the resulting lexer may not compile successfully.
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h3><a name="SECTION2.2.17">2.2.17 Specifying the Return Value on End-of-File</a></h3>
<p>
The <i>%eofval{ ... %eofval}</i> directive
specifies the return value on end-of-file.
This directive allows the user to write Java code to be
copied into the lexical analyzer tokenizing 
function <i>Yylex.yylex()</i> 
for execution when the end-of-file is reached.
This code must return a value compatible with 
the type of the tokenizing function <i>Yylex.yylex()</i>.<br>
<i>%eofval{ </i><br>
<i>&lt;code&gt;</i><br>
<i>%eofval} </i><br>
The specified Java code in <i>&lt;code&gt;</i> 
determines the return value of <i>Yylex.yylex()</i>
when the end-of-file is reached for the input file
the lexical analyzer class is processing.
This will also be the value returned by <i>Yylex.yylex()</i>
each additional time this function is called
after end-of-file is initially reached,
so <i>&lt;code&gt;</i> may be executed more than once.
Finally, the <i>%eofval{</i> and <i>%eofval}</i> directives
should be situated at the beginning of a line.
</p><p>
An example of usage is given below.
Suppose the return value desired on end-of-file is 
<i>(new token(sym.EOF))</i> rather than 
the default value <i>null</i>.
The user adds the following declaration to the
specification file.<br>
<i>%eofval{ </i><br>
<i>return (new token(sym.EOF)); </i><br>
<i>%eofval} </i><br>
The code is then copied into <i>Yylex.yylex()</i>
into the appropriate place.<br>
<i>public Yytoken yylex () { ... </i><br>
<i>return (new token(sym.EOF)); </i><br>
<i>... } </i><br>
The value returned by <i>Yylex.yylex()</i> upon 
end-of-file and from that point onward is now
<i>(new token(sym.EOF))</i>.
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<h3><a name="SECTION2.2.18">2.2.18 Specifying an interface to implement</a></h3>
<p>
JLex allows the user to specify an interface which the <i>Yylex</i>
class will implement.  By adding the following declaration to the input
file:<br>
<i>%implements &lt;classname&gt;</i><br>
the user specifies that Yylex will implement <i>classname</i>.  The
generated parser class declaration will look like:<br>
<tt>
class Yylex implements <i>classname</i> { ...
</tt>
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h3><a name="SECTION2.2.19">2.2.19 Making the Generated Class Public</a></h3>
<p>
The <i>%public</i> directive causes the lexical analyzer class
generated by JLex to be a public class.<br>
<i>%public</i><br>
The default behavior adds no access specifier to the generated
class, resulting in the class being visible only from the current
package.
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h2><a name="SECTION2.3">2.3 Regular Expression Rules</a></h2>
<p>
The third part of the JLex specification consists
of a series of rules for breaking the input stream into tokens.
These rules specify regular expressions, then associate
these expressions with actions consisting of Java source code.
</p><p>
The rules have three distinct parts: 
the optional state list, the regular expression, 
and the associated action.
This format is represented as follows.<br>
[<i>&lt;states&gt;</i>]  <i>&lt;expression&gt; { &lt;action&gt; }</i><br>
Each part of the rule is discussed in a section below.
</p><p>
If more than one rule matches strings from its input,
the generated lexer resolves conflicts between rules
by greedily choosing the rule that matches the longest string.
If more than one rule matches strings of the same length,
the lexer will choose the rule that is given first in
the JLex specification.
Therefore, rules appearing earlier in the specification
are given a higher priority by the generated lexer.
</p><p>
The rules given in a JLex specification should 
match all possible input.  
If the generated lexical analyzer receives input that
does not match any of its rules, 
an error will be raised.
</p><p>
Therefore, all input should be matched by at least one rule.  
This can be guaranteed by placing the following rule 
at the bottom of a JLex specification:<br>
<i>. { java.lang.System.out.println("Unmatched input: " + yytext()); 
}</i><br>
The dot (.), as described below, will match any input
except for the newline.
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h3><a name="SECTION2.3.1">2.3.1 Lexical States</a></h3>
<p>
An optional lexical state list preceeds each rule.
This list should be in the following form:<br>
<i>&lt;</i>state[0][<i>, state[1], state[2], ...</i>]<i>&gt;</i><br>
The outer set of brackets ([]) indicate that multiple states are optional.
The greater than (&lt;) and less than (&gt;) symbols 
represent themselves and should surround the state
list, preceding the regular expression.
The state list specifies under which initial states
the rule can be matched.
</p><p>
For instance, if <i>yylex()</i> is called with 
the lexer at state <i>A</i>, 
the lexer will attempt to match the input only 
against those rules that have 
<i>A</i> in their state list.
</p><p>
If no state list is specified for a given rule, 
the rule is matched against in all lexical states.
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h3><a name="SECTION2.3.2">2.3.2 Regular Expressions</a></h3>
<p>
Regular expressions should not contain any white space,
as white space is interpreted as the end of 
the current regular expression.
There is one exception; if (non-newline) white 
space characters appear from within double quotes, 
these characters are taken to represent themselves.
For instance, `` '' is interpreted as a blank space.
</p><p>
The alphabet for JLex is the Ascii character set, 
meaning character codes between 0 and 127 inclusive.
</p><p>
The following characters are metacharacters, with 
special meanings in JLex regular expressions.<br>
</p><pre><h4>? * + | ( ) ^ $ . [ ] { } " \</h4></pre><br>
Otherwise, individual characters stand for themselves.
<p>
<i>ef</i> Consecutive regular expressions represents
their concatenation.
</p><p>
<i>e</i>|<i>f</i> The vertical bar (|) represents an option between
the regular expressions that surround it, so  
matches either expression <i>e</i> or <i>f</i>.
</p><p>
The following escape sequences are recognized and expanded:
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>\b</td>
<td>Backspace</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\n</td>
<td>newline</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\t</td>
<td>Tab</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\f</td>
<td>Formfeed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\r</td>
<td>Carriage return</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\<i>ddd</i></td>
<td>The character code corresponding to the number formed by three octal
digits <i>ddd</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\x<i>dd</i></td>
<td>The character code corresponding to the number formed by two
hexadecimal digits <i>dd</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\u<i>dddd</i></td>
<td>The Unicode character code corresponding to the number formed by
four hexidecimal digits <i>dddd</i>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\^<i>C</i></td>
<td>Control character</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\<i>c</i></td>
<td>A backslash followed by any other character <i>c</i> matches itself</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
$ The dollar sign ($) denotes the end of a line.
If the dollar sign ends a regular expression, the expression
is matched only at the end of a line.
</p><p>
. The dot (.) matches any character except the newline,
so this expression is equivalent to [^\n].
</p><p>
"..." Metacharacters lose their meaning within
double quotes and represent themselves.
The sequence <code>\"</code> (which represents the
single character <code>"</code>) is the only exception.

</p><p>
<i>{name}</i> Curly braces denote a macro expansion,
with <i>name</i> the declared name of the associated macro.
</p><p>
* The star (*) represents Kleene closure and matches 
zero or more repetitions of the preceding regular expression.
</p><p>
+ The plus (+) matches one or more repetitions of the 
preceding regular expression, so <i>e</i>+ is equivalent to <i>ee</i>*.
</p><p>
? The question mark (?) matches zero or one repetitions
of the preceding regular expression.
</p><p>
(...) Parentheses are used for grouping within regular
expressions.
</p><p>
[...] Square backets denote a class of characters
and match any one character enclosed in the backets.  If the
first character following the left bracket ([) is 
the up arrow (^),
the set is negated and the expression matches any character
except those enclosed in the backets.  Different
metacharacter rules hold inside the backets, with the
following expressions having special meanings:
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i>{name}</i></td>
<td>Macro expansion</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>a</i> - <i>b</i></td>
<td>Range of character codes from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> to be included in
character set</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"..."</td>
<td>All metacharacters within double quotes lose
their special meanings. The sequence <code>\"</code> (which represents the
single character <code>"</code>) is the only exception.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\</td>
<td>Metacharacter following backslash(\) loses its special meaning</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

</p><p>
For example, [a-z] matches any lower-case letter, [^0-9] 
matches anything except a digit, and [0-9a-fA-F] matches any hexadecimal
digit. 
Inside character class brackets,
a metacharacter following a backslash loses its special meaning.
Therefore, [\-\\] matches a dash or a backslash.
Likewise ["A-Z"] matches one of the three characters A, dash, or Z.
Leading and trailing dashes in a character class also lose their
special meanings, so [+-] and [-+] do what you would expect them to
(ie, match only '+' and '-').
</p><p>
<br> </p><p>
</p><h3><a name="SECTION2.3.3">2.3.3 Associated Actions</a></h3>
<p>
The action associated with a lexical rule consists
of Java code enclosed inside block-delimiting curly braces.<br>
<i>{ action } </i><br>
The Java code <i>action</i> is copied, as given, into 
the state-driven lexical analyzer produced by JLex.
</p><p>
All curly braces contained in <i>action</i> not part of strings or comments
should be balanced.
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h4><a name="SECTION2.3.3.1">2.3.3.1 Actions and Recursion:</a></h4>
<p>
If no return value is returned in an action, the 
lexical analyzer will loop, searching for the next match 
from the input stream and returning the value
associated with that match.
</p><p>
The lexical analyzer can be made to recur explicitly
with a call to <i>yylex()</i>, as in the following 
code fragment.<br>
<i>{ ...</i> <br>
<i>return yylex();</i> <br>
<i>... } </i> <br>
This code fragment causes the lexical analyzer to recur, 
searching for the next match in the input
and returning the value associated with that match.
The same effect can be had, however, by simply
not returning from a given action.  
This results in the lexer searching for the next match,
without the additional overhead of recursion.
</p><p>
The preceding code fragment is an example of tail recursion,
since the recursive call comes at the end of 
the calling function's execution.
The following code fragment is an example of a recursive
call that is not tail recursive.<br>
<i>{ ...</i> <br>
<i>next = yylex();</i> <br>
<i>... } </i> <br>
Recursive actions that are not tail-recursive work
in the expected way, 
except that variables such as 
<i>yyline</i> and <i>yychar</i>
may be changed during recursion.
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h4><a name="SECTION2.3.3.2">2.3.3.2 State Transitions:</a></h4>
<p>
If lexical states are declared in the JLex
directives section, transitions on these states
can be declared within the regular expression actions.
State transitions are made by the following 
function call.<br>
<i>yybegin(state);</i><br>
The void function <i>yybegin()</i> is passed the state 
name <i>state</i> and effects a transition to
this lexical state.
</p><p>
The state <i>state</i> must be declared within the JLex
directives section, or this call will result in a
compiler error in the generated source file.
The one exception to this declaration requirement is
state <i>YYINITIAL</i>, the lexical state 
implicitly declared by JLex.
The generated lexer begins lexical analysis in state
<i>YYINITIAL</i> and remains in this state until
a transition is made.

<br> <p>
</p><h1><a name="SECTION3">3. Generated Lexical Analyzers</a></h1>
<p>
JLex will take a properly-formed specification
and transform it into a Java source file for the
corresponding lexical analyzer.
</p><p>
The generated lexical analayzer resides in the class <i>Yylex</i>.
There are two constructors to this class, both requiring a single argument:
the input stream to be tokenized.
The input stream may either be of type <code>java.io.InputStream</code>
or <code>java.io.Reader</code> (such as <code>StringReader</code>). 
Note that the <code>java.io.Reader</code> constructor should be used
if you are generating a lexer accepting unicode characters, as the JDK
1.0 <code>java.io.InputStream</code> class does not always read unicode
correctly.
</p><p>
The access function to the lexer is <i>Yylex.yylex()</i>,
which returns the next token from the input stream.
The return type is <i>Yytoken</i> and the function is declared 
as follows.<br>
<i>class Yylex { ... </i><br>
<i>public Yytoken yylex () {</i><br>
<i>... } </i><br>
The user must declare the type of <i>Yytoken</i> and 
can accomplish this conveniently in the
first section of the JLex specification, the user 
code section.  For instance, to make <i>Yylex.yylex()</i>
return a wrapper around integers,
the user would enter the following code somewhere
preceding the first ``%%''.<br>
<i>class Yytoken { int field; Yytoken(int f) { field=f; } } </i><br>
Then, in the lexical actions, wrapped integers would
be returned, in something like this way.<br>
<i>{ ...</i><br>
<i>return new Yytoken(0); </i><br>
<i>... } </i><br>
Likewise, in the user code section, a class could be defined
declaring constants that correspond to each of the token types.<br>
<i>class TokenCodes { ... </i><br>
<i>public static final STRING = 0; </i><br>
<i>public static final INTEGER = 1; </i><br>
<i>... } </i><br>
Then, in the lexical actions, these token codes could be 
returned.<br>
<i>{ ...</i><br>
<i>return new Yytoken(STRING); </i><br>
<i>... } </i><br>
These are simplified examples; in actual use, one would probably
define a token class containing more information than an integer
code.
</p><p>
These examples begin to illustrate the object-oriented 
techniques a user could employ to define an arbitrarily 
complex token type to be returned by <i>Yylex.yylex()</i>.
In particular, inheritance permits the user to return more
than one token type.  If a distinct token type was needed
for strings and integers, the user could make the
following declarations.<br>
<i>class Yytoken { ... } </i><br>
<i>class IntegerToken extends Yytoken { ... } </i><br>
<i>class StringToken extends Yytoken { ... } </i><br>
Then the user could return both <i>IntegerToken</i> and
<i>StringToken</i> types from the lexical actions.
</p><p>
The names of the lexical analyzer class, the tokening function,
and its return type each may be altered using the
JLex directives.  See the section <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/JLex/current/manual.html#SECTION2.2.9">2.2.9</a>
for more details.
</p><p>
<br> </p><p> </p><hr>
<h1><a name="SECTION4">4. Performance</a></h1>
<p>
A benchmark experiment was conducted, comparing the performance
of a lexical analyzer generated by JLex to that
of a hand-written lexical analyzer.
The comparison was made for lexical analyzers 
of a simple ``toy'' programming language.
The hand-written lexical analyzer,
like the lexical analyzer generated by JLex,
was written in Java.
</p><p>
The experiment consists of running each lexical analyzer 
on two source files written in the toy language, 
then measuring the time required to process these files.
Each lexical analyzer was invoked by a dummy driver also
written in Java.
</p><p>
The generated lexical analyzer proved to be quite quick,
as the following results show.
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Size of Source File</th>
<th>JLex-Generated Lexical Analyzer: Execution Time</th>
<th>Hand-Written Lexical Analyzer: Execution Times</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="middle">177 lines</td>
<td align="middle">0.42 seconds</td>
<td align="middle">0.53 seconds</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="middle">897 lines</td>
<td align="middle">0.98 seconds</td>
<td align="middle">1.28 seconds</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

</p><p>
The JLex lexical analyzer soundly outperformed 
the hand-written lexer.
</p><p>
One of the biggest complaints about table-driven lexical analyzers
generated by programs like JLex is that these lexical analyzers
do not perform as well as hand-written ones.
Therefore, this experiment is particularly important in
demonstrating the relative speed of JLex lexical analyzers.

<p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h2><a name="SECTION5.1">5.1 Unimplemented Features</a></h2>
<p>
The following is a (possibly incomplete) list of 
unimplemented features of JLex.
</p><ol>
<li> The regular expression lookahead operator is unimplemented,
and not included in the list of special regular
expression metacharacters.</li><li> The start-of-line operator (^) assumes 
the following nonstandard behavior.
A match on a regular expression that uses 
this operator will cause the newline that
precedes the match to be discarded.
</li></ol><br> <hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h2><a name="SECTION5.2">5.2 Unicode vs Ascii</a></h2>
<p>
In contrast to the 8-bit character type (char) mandated by
Ansi C, Java supports a 16-bit char and the Unicode 
character set.  Java provides a built-in String class to 
manipulate these Unicode characters.
</p><p>
As of version 1.2.5, JLex uses the JDK 1.1 <code>Reader</code> and
<code>Writer</code> classes to read in the JLex specification
file and write out the lexical analyzer source file.  This
means that all unicode characters are allowed in both of these.
In order for the generated scanner to work with unicode characters,
you must use the <code>java.io.Reader</code> constructor of the 
generated scanner, and the <code>Reader</code> you provide must
properly handle the translation from OS-native format to unicode.
You must also specify the <i>%unicode</i> directive in the
specification; see section <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/JLex/current/manual.html#SECTION2.2.14">2.2.14</a>.
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h2><a name="SECTION5.3">5.3 Commas in State Lists</a></h2>
<p>
Commas between state names in declaration lists and lexical
rules are optional.  These lists will be correctly parsed
with white space between state names and without 
comma separators.
</p><p>
<br> </p><hr>
<br> <p>
</p><h2><a name="SECTION5.4">5.4 Wish List of Unimplemented Features</a></h2>
<p>
The following minor features would be nice to have as part of JLex,
but have not been implemented due to their scope or their negative
impact upon performance.
</p><ol><li> Detection of unbalanced braces within the comment
portion of lexical actions.</li><li> Detection of cycles in macro definitions.
